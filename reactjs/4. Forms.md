1. Build a basic signup form which takes name, email, password and confirm password fields.
2. Add validations on submit button, validations are:

- no field should be empty
- password and confirm password should be same
- email should have @ and . symbols in it.

3. Show errors if the validations fail

Values entered in the input fields should be stored in state.
Error values should not be stored in state but should be calculated from above state.
