1. In the signup form you built above:

- Have a switch out side the form component
- If that switch is toggled input field for username should be shown. (Validations should be present for username)
- If the switch is toggled again username shouldn't be shown. (Validations shouldn't be present for username)
  State for switch toggling should be in a context and shared using useContext between form and switch

2. Explain why context is useful even though we can lift state to parent and update it from child
